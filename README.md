# DDPGforRoboticsControl
This is an implementation of Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm named Deep determinsitic Policy Gradient (DDPG) to train a 2 DOF robotic Arm to reach the moving target. The action space is continous and the learned agent outputs the torque for the robot to move to the specific target location.
